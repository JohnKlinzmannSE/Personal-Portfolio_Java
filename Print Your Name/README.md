# Project: Print Your Name

1. Write a program that outputs a pattern for each letter of your name.
2. Each letter must be uppercase and be five characters in height and no more than 5 characters in width. 

   - For example, if the first letter of your name started with the letter "H", the output for the first letter would look like:

           H   H
           H   H
           HHHHH
           H   H
           H   H
   
3. End each line with a newline.
4. Print your full first name as output.
5. My name is "John", so I will be printing "JOHN".
