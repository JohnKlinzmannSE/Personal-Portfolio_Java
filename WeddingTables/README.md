# Project: Wedding Tables

1. Write a program that calculates the number of full tables for a wedding
   event, based on the number of expected guests. Each full table will
   seat 10 wedding guests.


2. Collect one integer input and assign it to the variable guests. Using
   integer division, calculate the total number of tables that will be filled.
   The variable tableSize has been declared and initialized and the
   variables guests and tablesFilled have been declared in the template
   code.


3. Output the number of tables filled, ending with a newline. Ensure your
   program output matches the example formatting below and works for
   a variety of input values.
   

4. <b>If the input is:</b><br>
   340<br>
   <b>the output is:</b><br>
   Tables filled: 34<br>
   <b>Alternatively, if the input is:</b><br>
   349<br>
   <b>the output is:</b><br>
   Tables filled: 34
